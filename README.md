# English-French-Translator
* This is an an English-French Translator with Deep Learning Model Transformer.
* I mainly used Torch package to train the Sequence to Sequence model on dataset of Engligh-French question translations.

### [Transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model) "Wikipedia")
A transformer is a deep learning model used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV) and audio processing. Transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once.
